# LinESC-1
I was tasked with gaining initial access to a designated box and finding 7 different ways to escalate your privileges. A minimum of 5 successful privilege escalation techniques was required to pass, but I found all 7. 

- Privilege Escalation – Sudo Vulnerabilities 
- Privilege Escalation – Exploiting Readable /etc/shadow 
- Privilege Escalation – SUID Privileges
- Privilege Escalation – Cronjobs
- Privilege Escalation – SSH Vulnerabilities 
- Privilege Escalation – Kernel Exploitation 
- Privilege Escalation – NFS no-root-squashing
